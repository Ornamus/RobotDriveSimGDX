    <small class="h5 text-muted">How to run the Power Up Simulator by Ryan Shavell from Team 1902</small>
    <br><br>

    <p>
    Oh boy, quickly writing simulator instructions that should have been written ages ago! Hopefully these are sufficient
        and help you get everything going. If not, well... I'll know what to change for the public release's instructions! :)
    </p>

    <hr><h3>Launching and Setup</h3><br>

    <li>
        You launch the simulator with <code>run.bat</code>. If you want to change the program arguments, you change them in <code>run.bat</code>.
       </li><br>

    <li>You need one USB controller per robot you want on the field. If you want to have drivers AND manipulators, you'll need two USB controllers per robot. To enable this,
    add the keyword <code>manipulators</code> to the program arguments in <code>run.bat</code>.</li><br>

    <li>The USB controller needs to be similar in basic functionality to a Playstation or XBox controller; you'll
    want two joysticks, the four button thingy, a DPad, bumpers, triggers, and start/select present on the
    controller. If it's not a super generic XBox or Logitech controller, you'll need to map it first using
        the controller mapping tool, called <code>Controller Mapping.bat</code>. Launch
    it with the controller(s) you want to map plugged in, follow the instructions, close it when you're done.
        The controller should work in the main game now.</li>

    <hr><h3>Controls</h3><br>

    <h5 class="text-primary">Configuring Robots <small class="text-muted">(Done in sandbox mode/before a match)</small></h5>
    <li>Start (the left button on the middle): change drive controls (options are arcade, split arcade, tank, chezy drive)</li>
    <li>Select (the right button on the middle): change robot alliance color</li>
    <li>DPad Right: Change robot's team number</li>
    <li>DPad Down: Change robot type (different robots have different stats/abilities)</li>

    <br><h5 class="text-primary">Playing a Robot</h5>
    <p class="text-muted">Note: A blue <b class="text-primary">M</b> means that this control is available to the manipulator if there is one.</p>

    <li>Right Bumper: Intake Cube (<b class="text-primary">M</b>)
    <li>Right Bumper: Outtake Cube (<b class="text-primary">M</b>)
    <li>Left Bumper: Outtake Cube from Back <small class="text-muted">(not all robots have this)</small> (<b class="text-primary">M</b>)
    <li>DPad Up: Eject a cube from the top alliance portal (<b class="text-primary">M</b>)</li>
    <li>DPad Down: Eject a cube from the bottom alliance portal (<b class="text-primary">M</b>)</li>
    <li>Activating Powerup #1 (Boost): Left button in the 4 button grid</li>
    <li>Activating Powerup #2 (Force): Bottom button in the 4 button grid</li>
    <li>Activating Powerup #3 (Levitate): Right button in the 4 button grid</li>
    <li>Flipping An Arm: Top button in the 4 button grid <small class="text-muted">(not all robots have this)</small> (<b class="text-primary">M</b>)
    <li>Holding Left or Right trigger: Low Gear (robot drives slower) <small class="text-muted">(not all robots have this)</small></li>



    <br><h5 class="text-primary">Non-Robot Controls</h5>
    <li><kbd>P</kbd> (keyboard): Start a match</li>
    <li><kbd>I</kbd> (keyboard): Cancel a Match</li>
    <li><kbd>R</kbd> (keyboard): Reset the field</li>

    <hr><h3>Gameplay</h3><br>
    The game is designed to as closely mirror Power Up in all ways; during a match, point values and criteria should almost exactly
    match the FRC game manual. The only exceptions/differences are as follows:<br><br>
    <li>There's no automated penalities. This means the game doesn't penalize you for, say, getting hit in your opponent's null zone.</li>
    <li>The simulator hasn't been updated for Team Update 3, so the two switches won't match each other like Team Update 3 dictates (I'll be correcting this very soon)</li>
    <li>There's a couple <i>graphical</i> issues with the Scale: robots appear to drive over it, and cubes appear to phase over it as well. This is a graphical glitch; robots
    who can score on the switch can place cubes onto the Scale, and robots will be able to drive "under" these cubes despite it graphically not appearing as such. Similarly,
    robots who can't score on the Scale can't actually place cubes <i>onto</i> the scale; they won't be counted and can be ran into by other robots. This will make more sense
    once you play and try this out for yourself.</li>


    <hr><h3>Support</h3><br>
    <p>The simulator is rough around the edges and this isn't even a public release build; because of this, there will be bugs
    and problems. Most (some?) of them can be fixed by rebooting the simulator. If not, message me (Ryan S) on Discord or email me at
        <a href="mailto:ryan.shavell@gmail.com">ryan.shavell@gmail.com</a>.</p>
